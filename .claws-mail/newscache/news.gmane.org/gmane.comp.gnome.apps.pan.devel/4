Here's the point I was trying to make-- I clearly wasn't clear enough 
about it before because nobody but me saw it:
To keep binary compatibility with the older gtkspell, I can't introduce 
new functionality without doing some hacks (for example, it'd be nice to 
specify the language and encoding to gtkspell_attach to allow per-view 
lang/charset, but that changes the API).  So I was looking for advice in 
two separate ways:
  - what can be changed without breaking backward compat (2.0.x)
  - what needs to be changed for the future (2.1.x)
Realistically, this means that 2.1 will probably happen after the new 
releases mentioned below.

But this mention of character sets is interesting-- how are you putting 
non-UTF8 data in a GtkTextView without Gtk complaining?

What are these "exceptions" you speak of?  I am a C programmer. :P

I'll check out the Pan CVS to see what Pan is doing...

Hm, that's interesting.  You rebuid the entire text view, but GtkSpell 
doesn't affect it?  GtkSpell just attaches to the insert-text signal 
(among others), both before and after it runs, and uses the difference 
between the insertion point across that operation to see what has changed.


Anyway, I'll investigate those bugs and just drop the language stuff 
until it can be done properly.
I'll try to restrict discussing further development to the 
gtkspell-devel mailing list, too, so feel free to sign up or read the 
archives.


Thanks,
Evan.
