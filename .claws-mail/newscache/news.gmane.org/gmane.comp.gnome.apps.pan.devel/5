Introducing new functions shouldn't break backwards compatability.
So adding gtk_spell_attach_language (GtkTextView*, language) wouldn't harm
anyone so long as gtk_spell_attach (GtkTextView*) still existed.

(In fact, gtk_spell_attach() would probably be implemented as a wrapper
around gtk_spell_attach_language, passing the default language as the
second argument.)

We're not.  It's all UTF-8 inside of the textview, then it's
iconv()ed to the user's preferred charset when posting.
(Or at least that's what will do when I fix 0.12.92's bug. ;)

http://mail.freesoftware.fsf.org/pipermail/pan-users/2002-July/001500.html
and http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89657 are both cases of aspell
throwing an exception that nobody's catching, which causes Pan to crash.

I would file this as a bug report to aspell, but it appears that aspell
is both (a) no longer being maintained and (b) being rewritten, with the
new version in a "pre-alpha" state (http://aspell.sourceforge.net/).

Not sure what to do about this.

I haven't looked into this, I'm just passing along what a user reported.
The user could be smoking crack. :)

Cool.
