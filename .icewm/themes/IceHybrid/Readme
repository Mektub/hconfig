1.  Introduction

The goal of this theme is to make IceWM look as much like Ubuntu's release 'Dapper Drake'. This includes Ubuntu's titlebars and buttons, colours, and a few icons. 


2.  Installation

This directory ("IceBuntu") should be copied to your IceWM theme directory, usually /usr/share/icewm/themes. The "icons" directory that comes with this theme includes icons you can use in your menus and toolbar. They are taken from the tango project, and most of them represent the different categories for your menu. As of this date, the Gnome menu has the following submenus: Accessories, Graphics, Internet, Office, Multimedia and System Tools.
