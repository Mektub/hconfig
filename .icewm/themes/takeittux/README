You have a better OS than those Linux weenies and you want everybody
to know. :)

This is the icewm theme takeittux, based on the popular picture
at http://www.attrition.org/gallery/other/takeittux.jpg
For the most part, this just copies the win95 theme by Marko
Marcek.

The files fulldaemon.xpm and daemonhead.xpm can be replaced at
<icewm root>/taskbar/linux.xpm to create a different (and cooler)
logo for the taskbar.  The picture takeittux.xpm and takeittux.jpg
are for the background.  The default is takeittux.jpg but you can
easily change that in default.theme.  The takeittux.xpm file is included
for completeness, however, because of its size, I recommend not using
it.
